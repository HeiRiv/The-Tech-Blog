    "description": "To solve those puzzles, RailVision collects data from rail operations to simulate train dynamics and uses an algorithm to determine the most fuel-efficient driving pattern. While the AI solution is still in its infancy, Jain says it has helped Metrolinx, a government agency that serves millions of riders in the province of Ontario, save more than 1.5 million liters of diesel fuel during a one-year experiment. RailVision also counts Via Rail Canada Inc., the countryâ€™s main intercity passenger train operator, as an early adopter."
